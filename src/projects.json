        "description": "I recently started indoor gardening and it was important for me to know the humidity and temperature so I thought I would try building a weather monitoring system for my plants. It tells me the air temperature and the humidity in which ever room it is placed in. It logs whenever there is a change in temperature to the display and stores it in a local database. This was built using the BME280 sensors.",
